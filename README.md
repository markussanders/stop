# 10 Seconds!


10 Seconds! was inspired by a game in a Chicago Chinatown cafe in which you can win a free boba/milk tea
if you score `10.000` seconds on a blind timer. What makes this seemingly-simple task difficult is the struggle of internalizing steady rhythmn.

In order to get better at this, I created three modes of difficulty:

  "EASY" –– where visual cues are displayed to signify each second,
  
  "HARD" –– where no cues are shown and instead taunts are displayed,
  
  "IMPOSSIBLE" –– similar to "HARD" in which there are no visual cues provided, however, unlike the previous three modes in          which achieving ten whole-seconds suffices a 'win', users must achieve a perfect "10.000".

This application was created using React.js. In the near future, I plan to:

  –– recreate this application using React Native
  
  –– incorporate audio cues for time keeping
  
  –– create different modes of gameplay such as a countdown timer and two-player options
